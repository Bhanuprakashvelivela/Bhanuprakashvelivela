## Hello Friends ðŸ‘‹. 

## About Me
I'm a highly competent Embedded Development Engineer, received my Master's Degree from University of Houston and Bachelor's Degree from Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management (GITAM). 

Experience in Developing applications for Automotive and Embedded Systems projects. Seeking to use development and debugging skills to raise profitability to the company and allow me to future improve my project management skills. I understand the target application project life cycle in depth and I'm very capable at all aspects of development from projects planning to requirements gathering to designing, coding, documentation, support and testing code creating. 

My technical acumen encompasses a wide array of -


-->Software & Programming Languages: Cadence Virtuoso, Vector Tools (CANape, CANoe), Jenkins, MATLAB, Xilinx Vivado, LabVIEW, AutoCAD, Verilog, Embedded C, and C++.

--> Testing Tools: CANoe, CANalyzer.

--> Communication Protocols: UART, SPI, I2C, CAN.

--> MCU Peripheral: GPIO, Timer, ADC, DMA, Interrupt.

--> Code Development IDEs: STM32CUBEIDE/MX, keil, Code Composer Studio, Arduino.

--> Microcontroller/Processor: Easily work with processor based on ARM Cortex M4-M7 32,16 and 8 bit architectures.
